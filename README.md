## Algorithms

In this repo, I have included the source code for various algorithms for well-known problems in Computer Science. Each of the solution is in a subfolder,
and has its own Readme file. A directory of the algorithmic solutions I have worked on so far are listed as follow.

- [x] [0-1 Knapsack Problem](https://github.com/JalalQ/Algorithms/tree/main/knapsack) - The objective of this problem is to select items with varying weights, 
under the objective of maximally filling the bag, and given the constraint of the bag having fixed capacity.
